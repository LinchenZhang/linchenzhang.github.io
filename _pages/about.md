I am an Economics Ph.D. student at University of California San Diego (Cohort 2021). 

My research interests are microeconomics theory and behavioral economics, with a focus on robust mechanism design.

* [Participation-Adaptive Pricing](/files/bdz_pricing.pdf)
  * with [Benjamin Brooks](https://www.benjaminbrooks.net/) and [Songzi Du](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~sodu/)
  * Abstract: A large number of buyers with single unit demand have a common value for the good
being sold. We describe a new class of mechanisms, which we refer to as participationadaptive pricing: Each prospective buyer indicates whether or not they want to buy a
good, available goods are rationed among those who wish to purchase, and the market
price is an increasing function of the number of buyers who wish to purchase. We
characterize a class of pricing rules for which, as the number of buyers grows large,
the expected market price converges to the expected value, regardless of the buyers’
information and equilibrium strategies.

* Revenue Guarantee across Bayes Coarse Correlated Equilibria (draft coming soon)
  * Abstract: I study the revenue guarantee across all Bayes coarse correlated equilibria, starting with the analysis in a first-price auction and common value setting. I first show that it suffices to only examine identical-play equilibria, and based on it, I give characteristic functions for the revenue guarantee assuming a continuous value distribution. The asymptotic revenue guarantee of a continuous distribution is equal to that under Bayes correlated equilibria in the literature. Moreover, I characterize the revenue guarantee for a binary value distribution, which gives the minimum revenue guarantee level among all value distributions. Finally, I show that all the results will still apply under a standard auction and symmetric prior environment.
