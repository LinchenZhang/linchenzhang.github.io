I am an Economics Ph.D. student at University of California San Diego (Cohort 2021). 

My research interests are microeconomics theory and behavioral economics, with a focus on robust and/or simple mechanism design. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Songzi Du](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~sodu/).

You can find my detailed CV [here](/files/Linchen_Zhang_CV_2026_01.pdf).

Happy browsing!

* [An Informationally-Robust Market Model of Perfect Competition](/files/bdz_market.pdf) (Jul 2025)
  * with [Benjamin Brooks](https://www.benjaminbrooks.net/) and [Songzi Du](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~sodu/)
  * Abstract: A large number of buyers with single unit demand have a common value for a good
being sold. Buyers decide whether or not they wish to purchase the good; the goods
are rationed among those who wish to purchase; and the market price is a function of
the number of buyers who wish to purchase. We characterize pricing rules for which, as
the number of buyers grows large, the expected market price converges to the expected
value, regardless of the buyers’ information and equilibrium strategies: these are pricing
rules that have vanishing price impact and are asymptotically inelastic. Interpreting
the pricing rule as a market supply function, we also prove that as long as the pricing
rule has vanishing price impact, then in the large market, welfare is at least at the level
when the buyers have no information about the value. We extend our results to the
case where there is also an idiosyncratic component to the value and where buyers have
multi-unit demands.

* [Coarse Revenue Guarantee in First Price Auction and Beyond](/files/RG_BCCE_Linchen_Zhang.pdf) (Feb 2026)
  * Abstract: I analyze the coarse revenue guarantee, defined as the minimum expected revenue across all Bayes Coarse Correlated Equilibria (BCCE), in the First Price Auction (FPA). This approach generalizes the standard revenue guarantee—based on Bayes Correlated Equilibrium (BCE)—established by Bergemann, Brooks and Morris (2017, ECMA) in the FPA. Because BCCE characterizes the limit points of no-regret learning dynamics, this metric provides a more robust lower bound for markets populated by algorithmic or AI agents. I characterize the coarse revenue guarantee using a reduction to ``identical play equilibria,'' in which bidders adopt identical strategies regardless of their private signals. I prove that while the coarse revenue guarantee is strictly lower than the BCE-based guarantee for any finite number of buyers, the two measures converge asymptotically as the market grows. Furthermore, I develop a coarse revenue guarantee ranking over standard auctions, generalizing the logic of Bergemann, Brooks and Morris (2019, AER). I also extend the coarse analysis to all value distributions with a fixed expected value.
