* [Participation-Adaptive Pricing](/files/bdz_pricing.pdf)
  * with [Benjamin Brooks](https://www.benjaminbrooks.net/) and [Songzi Du](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~sodu/)
  * Abstract: A large number of buyers with single unit demand have a common value for the good
being sold. We describe a new class of mechanisms, which we refer to as participationadaptive pricing: Each prospective buyer indicates whether or not they want to buy a
good, available goods are rationed among those who wish to purchase, and the market
price is an increasing function of the number of buyers who wish to purchase. We
characterize a class of pricing rules for which, as the number of buyers grows large,
the expected market price converges to the expected value, regardless of the buyers’
information and equilibrium strategies.
