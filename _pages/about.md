Thanks for visiting my website! 

I am an Economics Ph.D. student at University of California San Diego (Cohort 2021). My research interests are microeconomics theory and behavioral economics, with a focus on robust mechanism design.

* Participation-Adaptive Pricing
  * with Songzi Du and Benjamin Brooks
  * Abstract: A large number of buyers with single unit demand have a common value for the good
being sold. We describe a new class of mechanisms, which we refer to as participationadaptive pricing: Each prospective buyer indicates whether or not they want to buy a
good, available goods are rationed among those who wish to purchase, and the market
price is an increasing function of the number of buyers who wish to purchase. We
characterize a class of pricing rules for which, as the number of buyers grows large,
the expected market price converges to the expected value, regardless of the buyers’
information and equilibrium strategies.

* First Price Auction Revenue Guarantee
  * Abstract: I analyze the First Price Auction revenue guarantee across all Bayes coarse correlated equilibria, under which the principal intends to sell a single unit and common value item to agents. I first show that it is sufficient to only examine identical-play equilibria, and based on it, I give characteristic functions for the revenue guarantee assuming a continuous value distribution. The asymptotic revenue guarantee of a continuous distribution is equal to the revenue guarantee under Bayes correlated equilibria in the literature. I then extend the model and characterize the revenue guarantee for a binary value distribution, which gives the minimum revenue guarantee level among all value distributions.
